# random-approver

> A random emoji generator in Rust


I have to approve a lot of pull requests, and I thought it would be fun to have a random emoji generator to use as an approver message. This is a simple Rust program that generates a random emoji from a predefined list.


## Usage

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
./target/release/random-approver
```
